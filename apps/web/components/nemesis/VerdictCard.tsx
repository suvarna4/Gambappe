/**
 * SW5-T2 · The Friday nemesis verdict card (swipe-ux-plan §2.9, P3). Both players get one; the
 * loser's carries the richer, funnier line. The week's closing decision is a throw —
 * `Run it back` (right, affirmative per D-SW9) requests the rematch, `New fate` (left) lets the
 * engine deal a new stranger. Those two are the accessible axis-ordered controls; a
 * `SwipeBallot variant="verdict"` wraps them as the gesture in the DB-equipped session (the
 * buttons remain the keyboard/AT path either way). Styled as the mockup's own `.hint` row
 * (`docs/mockups/swipe-ux.html` line ~881: `← NEW FATE` / `RUN IT BACK →`) — plain arrow-prefixed
 * text indicating swipe direction, not a bordered button box — while staying real `<button>`
 * elements underneath for the keyboard/AT path. Presentational: omit the handlers for the public
 * spectator card.
 *
 * Design-diff audit (round 2, mockup fidelity pass): the paper face now matches the mockup's
 * `.card` base treatment it was missing — a `.qcat`-style small-caps label row ("THE VERDICT" /
 * the real score, `docs/mockups/swipe-ux.html` line 873's "LOSER'S CARD" / "W30" slot), the
 * perforated top/bottom "ticket" edges (`.perf`), and the same faint horizontal paper-line
 * background texture (`background-image:linear-gradient(rgba(20,20,20,.028) 1px,transparent
 * 1px);background-size:100% 26px`). The outcome now ALSO gets its own small rotated stamp
 * (`OutcomeStamp`, reusing `@receipts/ui`'s `Stamp`/this file's sibling `DrawBadge` — the exact
 * `-7deg` rotated-label motif the mockup's own bottom-pinned `.stamp.loss` "TAKEN DOWN" uses,
 * `docs/mockups/swipe-ux.html` line 876), below the heading and margin line. The score no longer
 * repeats a second time next to the heading (the mockup shows it exactly once, in the `.vbolt`
 * badge `NemesisHeadToHeadBanner` already renders) — it moved into the qcat row instead, so it's
 * still real, still visible, just relocated to match where the mockup actually puts a meta line.
 * The day-by-day dot strip moved OUT of this card entirely, to `NemesisHeadToHeadBanner`'s own
 * strip below its score-tug bar — the mockup's `.dots` row sits between `.tug` and the loser's
 * card, never inside it.
 *
 * Design-diff audit (round 3): the card face is `max-w-[80%] mx-auto` — the mockup's own loser's
 * card is 180px inside a 250px phone screen (≈80% of the vsplit's own inset width, a
 * scale-invariant ratio — see round 4 below), a deliberately narrower, more compact "ticket"
 * than the full-bleed panel an earlier pass had. The action row is a `fixed inset-x-0 bottom-0`
 * bar (matching the mockup's own `.hint{position:absolute;bottom:9px}` — anchored to the bottom
 * of the screen, not just trailing the card in normal flow) — `app/nemesis/page.tsx` reserves
 * matching bottom space so the fixed bar never covers real content.
 *
 * Design-diff audit (round 4): every absolute measurement here (padding, radius, perforation,
 * qcat/heading font-sizes) is the mockup's own px value scaled ×1.4, not copied literally — an
 * earlier pass matched the mockup's raw pixels 1:1, which reproduces its layout at roughly 70%
 * of its actual physical size on a real mobile content column (≈340-350px) versus the mockup's
 * own 250px demo phone screen. Percentage widths (`max-w-[80%]`) and `em`-based tracking are
 * already scale-invariant and stay as-is. The heading's font-size is the mockup's own
 * EXHIBIT-SPECIFIC override for this card (15.5px, not the 22.5px base `.qh` rule — the mockup
 * shrinks the headline for this specific loser's-card instance) scaled the same way (×1.4 ≈
 * 22px).
 *
 * Not reproduced: the mockup's own bespoke headline for this exhibit ("Dropped 3–2. Third
 * straight week.") bakes in a losing-streak count this app doesn't track anywhere, and its body
 * line ("...by 11 points of edge...") uses the exact "edge" framing this card's own copy is
 * pinned against (`copy.ts`'s `verdictLoserLine`/`verdictWinnerLine` header) — both fabricated
 * relative to `nemesisHistoryEntrySchema`'s real fields, so this keeps the existing
 * margin-only heading/line instead of inventing either.
